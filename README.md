PROFILE:
Within the profile page, the user can see personal statistics such
as Age, Height, Current Badge and Level. 

Every 5 levels, the user can earn a new badge in the following order:

The User can create new workouts and set a name and goal. The workout

When the goal is completed, both the workout and progress bar will be 
removed from the dashboard and points will be updated.

list will be updated with the newly added friends.
